Welcome to the repository for the unofficial ChatGPT-3.5 Desktop App! This user-friendly application allows you to have natural language conversations
with ChatGPT directly from your local computer. This desktop application is built upon OpenAI's **gpt-3.5-turbo model**, which offers advanced natural
language processing capabilities. Through an intuitive user interface, you can easily engage in conversations with ChatGPT, review past interactions,
and even listen to the chatbot's responses through audio playback. The goal of this app is to provide an immersive and enjoyable conversational experience that
closely resembles interacting with a real person.

***Press the CTRL key and click the badge below simultaneously to run the application** (Please be aware that the audio playback functionality may not be available when running the application on Replit)*:
